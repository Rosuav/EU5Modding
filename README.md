Modding Europa Universalis V
============================

Clone this repository into your Paradox EU5 directory. On Linux, this goes into
your Proton directory (sorry, non-Steam users, I've no idea where it lands).

Expect things to be horrifically unbalanced and probably unfun, this is all
testing and tinkering. At some point a viable mod may emerge.
